You will need to create two dmv accounts, ask one of your friends for their account to use as a spare account. This is because when there is already an appointment in your own account, you cannot use that account to book or check more appointments. Having two account, you can use one to hold an appointment that you can get now, another one to check for better appointment times.

To use text message notification, you also need to create a Twilio account. It is free.

Fill your account infos in dmv_lib

Run ./check_appointment.py to check for appointment
Run ./cancel_appoinment.py to cancel an existing appointment
Run ./script to alternatively use two accounts to book better time slots.
